How can I install roboptim-core?
--------------------------------

RobOptim uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) to generate build files. For
instance, if you want to build roboptim-core in release with debug info, and
install it in `/my/prefix`, go to the root of the project folder and type:

    $ mkdir -p build && cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/prefix -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELWITHDEBINFO ..
    $ make && make test
    $ sudo make install

Where is the library documentation?
-----------------------------------

This **README** only covers configure/building issues. For more information
regarding this library usage, please refer to the Doxygen documentation.

If you have configured the package as explained in the first section, go
into your `build` directory and type:

    $ make doc

To view the HTML documentation: go in the `doc/doxygen-html` directory
and open `index.html` with your favorite internet browser.


How to use Valgrind with the test suite?
----------------------------------------

All the tests launched by the test suite can be prefixed
with the environment variable `CHECK_PREFIX`.

    $ cmake -DCHECK_PREFIX='valgrind --log-file=valgrind.log' ..
    $ make && make check
